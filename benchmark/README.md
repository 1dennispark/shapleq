# Benchmark
* This benchmark test compares ShapleQ and Kafkaâ€™s throughput  under specific conditions.
* Since ShapleQ is specialized at not stream collection but stream delivery, the number of consumers is  set as greater than the number of producer in the most of benchmark test.
* Covid-19 Twitter chatter dataset is used https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter  as data stream in the tests.
* Several test cases going to be added in accordance with future releases.
